# Estimating the 2-norm of the columns of a matrix

This repository contains an implementation of a random algorithm to approximate the squared 2-norm of each column of a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. The algorithm leverages randomization to efficiently compute these norms, which are very important in computational linear algebra. The estimator is likely to have been developed in a previously published paper that, however, was not available during the course of this project.

The project was developed for the course "Randomized Matrix Computations" at EPFL in the academic year 2024-2025, fall semester.
